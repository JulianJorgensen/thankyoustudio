        <p>In 1997, Swatch launched it’s very first SKIN watch - the thinnest watch in the world. 20 years later we helped them re-launch the collection with a new design catering to a new generation of strong and self-confident women.</p>

      <Text topPadding bottomPadding>The campaign is based on the watch’s almost weightless design and how that feature can make the wearer feel both free and confident. “Your Move” is about the thrill of the unknown, the beauty of movement and the anticipation of change. A playful celebration of both freedom and movement.</Text>
